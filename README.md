# Assignment:
Flask API with two endpoint connections. 
Stats: will display the stat object including number of vms, times the endpoint api's were requested and avg_request time to process.
Attack: will require a query of vm_id and will return a list of vm's which can potentially attack it.
- The code was tested on python version 3.8 on linux and 3.9/3.10 on windows.

## Assumption:
- Assuming that the path to the input data entered is correct. (otherwise instead of crashing, load ./data/input.json)

## Testing:
- navigate to project folder and use unittest discover with desired options. The tests are located in the tests folder along with their testing inputs.
- to run all tests from project folder run: `python -m unittest discover -v -s ./tests/`
<hr>

## Before running:
- Installing requirements can be done by navigating to the app folder and running the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the modules required.
<hr>

## Running:
- To run, navigate into the folder of the project to main.py and simply use ```python main.py``` or ```python3 main.py``` which will default to port 80 with default input file '.data/.
- It is possible to run using arguments input path should b.
  - Option: -i 'file_path' `-i data/new_file.json` - to set a new file input
  - Option: -p 'port_number' `-p 5000` - to change default (port=80).
  - Invoke using: `python3 main.py -i data/input-0.json` - to run on port 80
  
- The api has two endpoints which can be accessed as follows:
  - ```http://localhost/api/v1/stats```.
  - ```http://localhost/api/v1/attack?vm-id=vm-11111``` - which requires vm-id sent to it as a query.
